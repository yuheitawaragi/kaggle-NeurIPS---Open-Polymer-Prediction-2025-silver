# ðŸ¥ˆKaggle NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025 Silver

Kaggle competition silver (36/2240) solution<br>
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025". The goal of this competition is to develop a model that predicts a polymerâ€™s real-world performance metricsâ€”density, thermal conductivity (Tc), glass transition temperature (Tg), radius of gyration (Rg), and fractional free volume (FFV)â€”directly from its chemical structure (SMILES).

## Competition Overview

This competition challenges participants to predict fundamental polymer properties directly from their chemical structures. By building accurate models, we can accelerate materials discovery, enabling the development of sustainable and biocompatible polymers that benefit society and the environment.

## Competition Goal

This competition focuses on building models that can forecast key polymer propertiesâ€”density, thermal conductivity (Tc), glass transition temperature (Tg), radius of gyration (Rg), and fractional free volume (FFV)â€”directly from their chemical structures (SMILES).
