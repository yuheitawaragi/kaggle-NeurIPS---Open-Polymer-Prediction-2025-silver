# ðŸ¥ˆKaggle NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025 Silver

Kaggle competition silver (36/2240) solution<br>
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025". The goal of this competition is to develop a model that predicts a polymerâ€™s real-world performance metricsâ€”density, thermal conductivity (Tc), glass transition temperature (Tg), radius of gyration (Rg), and fractional free volume (FFV)â€”directly from its chemical structure (SMILES).
