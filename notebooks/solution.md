## ðŸ¥ˆKaggle NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025 Silver (My Solution)

# Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition "NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025".
The task is to build a model that predicts key polymer properties directly from their chemical structure (SMILES).
The target properties are:
* Density
* Thermal conductivity (Tc)
* Glass transition temperature (Tg)
* Radius of gyration (Rg)
* Fractional free volume (FFV)
